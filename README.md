## Description

Creating ReadMe's for your Github repository can be tedious.  I hope this template can save you time and effort as well as provide you with some consistency across your projects.
This application is a game between the user and a bot. It is based on conditional stateents, however the progra will accpet different ways of affermative statements etc. I am using a data base that has the movie name and character name in a .txt file. The questions and answers are taken from here.

#### Technologies

- JavaIO
- JavaFx
- JavaNIO
- Basic Java

## Working

### Data Base
[Data Base](/Project/cornell movie-dialogs corpus/movie_characters_metadata.txt)

This is a .txt file with involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies. 
- character metadata included:
	- gender (for 3,774 characters)
	- position on movie credits (3,321 characters)

-Data Preprocessing 

 The original delimiter used was ' +++$+++ '. This delimiter could not be used as the split function uses regular expressions, and could not accpet this. 

 The delimiter was changed to ';'.
